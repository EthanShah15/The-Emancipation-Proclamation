What to include:
Project title: The Emancipation Proclamation: A Step Toward Freedom


Your name


A short 1–2 sentence intro like:


 The Emancipation Proclamation was a turning point in American history. It didn’t free all enslaved people right away, but it changed the goal of the Civil War and started a path toward ending slavery.



Optional: background image of Lincoln or the Proclamation



Thesis
What to write:
The Emancipation Proclamation gave freedom to some enslaved people and let Black men fight in the Civil War. It didn’t end slavery on its own, but it helped lead to real change. This shows how getting rights comes with responsibility, and how one document can push a country to do better.

Background
What to write:
What slavery was like before 1863 (super basic):


 Before the Civil War, millions of African Americans were enslaved in the South. They had no rights and were treated like property.



Why the Civil War started:


 The North and South disagreed about slavery and states’ rights. The war began in 1861.



Lincoln’s position:


 At first, Lincoln just wanted to keep the Union together. But over time, he saw that ending slavery had to be part of it.




The Proclamation
What to include:
What it did:

 On January 1, 1863, Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation. It only said slaves in the Confederate states were free.



What it didn’t do:


 It didn’t free everyone — border states that stayed in the Union still had slavery.



A quote:


 “All persons held as slaves within said designated States... are, and henceforward shall be free.”




Black Soldiers & Action
What to include:
New right to join the army:


 After the Proclamation, Black men were allowed to join the Union Army.



Impact:


 About 200,000 African Americans fought in the war. They were fighting for their freedom.



Idea for personal story: maybe include a quote from a soldier like William H. Carney or look up the 54th Massachusetts



Consequences
What to include:
The war changed:


 The war wasn’t just about saving the Union anymore — now it was about freedom.



The South’s reaction:


 Southern leaders were mad. They didn’t accept it.



Didn’t free slaves in Union states:


 Slavery didn’t end everywhere until the 13th Amendment.




Rights & Responsibilities
What to include:
Rights gained:


 Enslaved people in the South were freed. Black men could fight in the war.



13th Amendment (1865):


 This law ended slavery in the whole country.



Responsibilities (use the ones you gave):


 Freedom came with responsibilities — people had to follow new laws, vote, stay involved, and treat others fairly.
 The country had to live up to its promises of justice.




Legacy
What to write:
Why it still matters:


 The Emancipation Proclamation was a first step. It showed that the government could take action for justice.



Impact later:


 It inspired later civil rights movements. Even Martin Luther King Jr. talked about it.



Personal connection idea:


 It makes me think about how hard it is to fight for change, but also how one action can make a difference.
