            <h2>Thesis</h2>
            <div class="content-box">
                <p>The Emancipation Proclamation gave freedom to some enslaved people and let Black men fight in the Civil War. It didn't end slavery on its own, but it helped lead to real change. This shows how getting rights comes with responsibility, and how one document can push a country to do better.</p>
                
                <h3>The Proclamation's Dual Impact</h3>
                <p>The Emancipation Proclamation served as both a practical wartime measure and a moral declaration. While it immediately freed enslaved people only in rebellious states, it fundamentally transformed the nature of the Civil War from a conflict about preserving the Union to a war for human freedom.</p>
                
                <h3>Rights and Responsibilities Connection</h3>
                <p>The document demonstrates the intrinsic link between gaining rights and accepting responsibilities. When African Americans gained the right to fight for their freedom, they also took on the responsibility of defending the Union and proving their worthiness as citizens.</p>
                
                <h3>Catalyst for Change</h3>
                <p>Though limited in scope, the Emancipation Proclamation set in motion a series of events that would eventually lead to the complete abolition of slavery through the 13th Amendment. It proved that presidential action could drive moral progress, even when politically risky.</p>
