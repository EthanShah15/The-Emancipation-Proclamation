                    <p>The Emancipation Proclamation gave freedom to many enslaved people and let Black men fight in the Civil War. It didn't end slavery on its own, but it helped lead to real change. This demonstrates how gaining rights comes with responsibility and how a single document can motivate an entire country to improve.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The Proclamation's Dual Impact</h3>
                    <p>The Emancipation Proclamation served as both a useful wartime measure and a moral declaration. While it immediately freed slaves only in rebellious Confederate states, it transformed the nature of the Civil War from a conflict about preserving the Union to a war for human freedom.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Rights and Responsibilities Connection</h3>
                    <p>The document demonstrates the intrinsic link between gaining rights and accepting responsibilities. When African Americans gained the right to fight for their freedom, they also took on the responsibility of defending the Union and proving their worth as citizens.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Catalyst for Change</h3>
                    <p>Though it was limited in scope, the Emancipation Proclamation set in motion a series of events that would eventually lead to the complete abolition of slavery through the 13th Amendment. It proved that presidential action could drive moral progress, even when it was politically risky.</p>
