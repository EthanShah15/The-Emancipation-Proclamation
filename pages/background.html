            <div class="content-box">
                <h3>Slavery Before 1863</h3>
                <p>Before the Civil War, millions of African Americans were enslaved in the South. They had no rights and were treated like property. The institution of slavery was deeply embedded in the Southern economy, particularly in cotton production, which generated enormous wealth for plantation owners.</p>
                
                <p>Enslaved people faced brutal conditions, family separations, and complete denial of basic human rights. They could not own property, marry legally, or receive education. Despite these harsh circumstances, enslaved communities developed strong bonds and resistance networks.</p>
                
                <h3>Why the Civil War Started</h3>
                <p>The North and South disagreed about slavery and states' rights. The war began in 1861 when Southern states seceded from the Union after Abraham Lincoln's election. The immediate cause was the South's fear that Lincoln would restrict or abolish slavery.</p>
                
                <p>Economic differences also fueled the conflict. The North had developed an industrial economy that relied on free labor, while the South remained agricultural and dependent on enslaved labor. These economic systems created fundamentally different societies with conflicting values.</p>
                
                <h3>Lincoln's Position</h3>
                <p>At first, Lincoln just wanted to keep the Union together. But over time, he saw that ending slavery had to be part of it. Initially, Lincoln's primary goal was preserving the Union, not abolishing slavery. He believed that if he could end the rebellion without touching slavery, he would do so.</p>
                
                <p>However, as the war progressed, Lincoln realized that slavery was the root cause of the conflict. He also recognized that freeing enslaved people could provide a strategic advantage by weakening the Confederacy and strengthening the Union cause.</p>
                
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p><strong>Key Point:</strong> The shift from a war to preserve the Union to a war for freedom represented a fundamental change in American values and Lincoln's own thinking about slavery and human rights.</p>
