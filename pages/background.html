                <h3>Slavery Before 1863</h3>
                <p>Before the Civil War, millions of African Americans were enslaved in the South. They had no rights and were treated like property. Slavery was deeply embedded in the Southern economy, particularly cotton production, which generated enormous wealth for plantation owners.</p>
                
                <p>Enslaved people faced brutal conditions, family separations, and denial of basic human rights. They could not own property, legally marry, or receive education. Despite these harsh circumstances, enslaved communities developed deep bonds and networks.</p>

                    <h3>Why the Civil War Started</h3>
                    <p>The North and South disagreed about slavery and State rights. The war began in 1861 when Southern states seceded from the Union after Abraham Lincoln's election. The immediate reason for this was the South's fear that Lincoln would restrict or abolish slavery.</p>
                    
                    <p>Economic differences also fueled the conflict. The North had developed an industrial economy that relied on free labor. On the other hand, the South remained agricultural and dependent on slave labor. These economic systems created fundamentally different societies with conflicting values.</p>

                <h3>Lincoln's Position</h3>
                <p>At first, Lincoln just wanted to keep the Union together. Gradually, over time, he saw that ending slavery had to be part of it. Initially, Lincoln's primary goal was to preserve the Union, not to abolish slavery. He believed that if he could end the rebellion without touching slavery, he would.</p>
                
                <p>However, as the war continued, Lincoln realized that slavery was the root cause of the conflict. He also recognized that freeing slaves could provide a strategic advantage by weakening the Confederacy, while strengthening the Union's cause.</p>
