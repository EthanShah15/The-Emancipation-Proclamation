            <div class="content-box">
                <h3>The War Changed</h3>
                <p>The Civil War wasn't just about saving the Union anymore - now it was about freedom. The Emancipation Proclamation fundamentally transformed the war's purpose, making it impossible for the conflict to end with slavery intact.</p>
                
                <p>This change also had an international impact. Previously, European countries like Britain and France considered supporting the Confederacy. Now, the Proclamation made it politically impossible for these countries, which opposed slavery, to back the South.</p>

                    <h3>The South's Reaction</h3>
                    <p>Southern leaders were mad. They didn't accept it. Confederate President Jefferson Davis called the Proclamation "the most execrable measure recorded in the history of guilty man." Southern newspapers denounced it as illegal and unconstitutional.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Confederacy used the Proclamation as propaganda, claiming it proved Lincoln's true intention was to destroy Southern society. However, many slaves in the South saw it as a beacon of hope and began fleeing to Union lines in greater numbers.</p>

                <h3>Northern Reactions</h3>
                <p>The North was divided in its response. Abolitionists celebrated the Proclamation as an overdue step toward justice. However, many Northern Democrats and some Republicans criticized Lincoln for exceeding his constitutional authority.</p>
                
                <p>Some Union soldiers, particularly those who had enlisted only to help the Union, were unhappy about fighting for Black freedom. Others embraced the expanded war goals, seeing the greater purpose they provided.</p>
                
                <h3>International Impact</h3>
                <p>The Proclamation effectively ended any chance of European intervention on behalf of the Confederacy. Both Britain and France had already abolished slavery in their nations, and could not support fighting to preserve human enslavement.</p>
                
                <p>This diplomatic victory was vital for the Union cause. It ensured that the Confederacy would fight alone, without foreign support that might have changed the war's outcome.</p>

            <div class="content-box">
                <h3>Limitations</h3>
                <p>Slavery didn't end everywhere until the 13th Amendment. The Proclamation's limitations meant that enslaved people in border states remained in bondage. This created a counterintuitive situation where the Union was fighting for the abolition of slavery while still permitting it in loyal states.</p>
                
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p><strong>Immediate Effect:</strong> Within days of the Proclamation, thousands of enslaved people escaped to Union lines. This sparked a refugee crisis that transformed the Union Army into a force for freedom.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h3>Military Consequences</h3>
                <p>The Proclamation weakened the Confederacy by encouraging slaves to escape and join Union forces. It also provided the Union with a recruiting tool among African Americans in both the North and South.</p>
                
                <p>Confederate forces now had to worry about internal security as well as external threats. The fear of slave uprisings forced the South to keep troops at home rather than sending them to the front lines.</p>
