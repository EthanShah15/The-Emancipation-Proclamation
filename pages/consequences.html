            <h2>Consequences</h2>
            <div class="content-box">
                <h3>The War Changed</h3>
                <p>The war wasn't just about saving the Union anymore â€” now it was about freedom. The Emancipation Proclamation fundamentally transformed the Civil War's moral purpose, making it impossible for the conflict to end with slavery intact.</p>
                
                <p>This change had international implications as well. European nations, particularly Britain and France, had been considering recognizing the Confederacy. The Proclamation made it politically impossible for these anti-slavery nations to support the South.</p>
                
                <h3>The South's Reaction</h3>
                <p>Southern leaders were mad. They didn't accept it. Confederate President Jefferson Davis called the Proclamation "the most execrable measure recorded in the history of guilty man." Southern newspapers denounced it as illegal and unconstitutional.</p>
                
                <p>The Confederacy used the Proclamation as propaganda, claiming it proved Lincoln's true intention was to destroy Southern society. However, many enslaved people in the South saw it as a beacon of hope and began fleeing to Union lines in greater numbers.</p>
                
                <h3>Northern Reactions</h3>
                <p>The North was divided in its response. Abolitionists celebrated the Proclamation as a long-overdue step toward justice. However, many Northern Democrats and some Republicans criticized Lincoln for exceeding his constitutional authority.</p>
                
                <p>Some Union soldiers, particularly those who had enlisted only to preserve the Union, were unhappy about fighting for Black freedom. Others embraced the expanded war aims, seeing the moral clarity it provided.</p>
                
                <h3>International Impact</h3>
                <p>The Proclamation effectively ended any chance of European intervention on behalf of the Confederacy. Britain and France, both having abolished slavery in their empires, could not support a nation fighting to preserve human bondage.</p>
                
                <p>This diplomatic victory was crucial for the Union cause. It ensured that the Confederacy would fight alone, without the foreign recognition and support that might have changed the war's outcome.</p>
                
                <h3>Limitations</h3>
                <p>Slavery didn't end everywhere until the 13th Amendment. The Proclamation's limited scope meant that enslaved people in border states remained in bondage. This created an awkward situation where the Union was fighting for freedom while still permitting slavery in loyal states.</p>
                
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p><strong>Immediate Effect:</strong> Within days of the Proclamation, thousands of enslaved people began fleeing to Union lines, creating a refugee crisis that forced the Union Army to become an agent of liberation.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h3>Military Consequences</h3>
                <p>The Proclamation weakened the Confederacy by encouraging enslaved people to escape and join Union forces. It also provided the Union with a powerful recruiting tool among African Americans in both the North and South.</p>
                
                <p>Confederate forces now had to worry about internal security as well as external threats. The possibility of slave uprisings forced the South to keep troops at home rather than sending them to the front lines.</p>
