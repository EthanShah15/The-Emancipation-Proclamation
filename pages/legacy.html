            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            <div class="content-box">
                <h3>Why It Still Matters</h3>
                <p>The Emancipation Proclamation was a first step. It showed that the government could take action for justice, even when it was politically difficult and constitutionally complex. The document established a precedent for federal intervention to protect human rights.</p>
                
                <p>More than just a historical document, the Proclamation represents the ongoing American struggle to live up to the ideals of freedom and equality. It demonstrates that progress is possible, even if it comes gradually and requires sustained effort.</p>
                
                <h3>Constitutional and Legal Legacy</h3>
                <p>The Proclamation paved the way for the Reconstruction Amendments (13th, 14th, and 15th), which fundamentally transformed the Constitution. These amendments established the principle that the federal government has the power and responsibility to protect individual rights against state interference.</p>
                
                <p>This constitutional framework later became the foundation for the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s, providing legal tools to challenge segregation and discrimination.</p>
                
                <h3>Impact on Later Civil Rights Movements</h3>
                <p>It inspired later civil rights movements. Even Martin Luther King Jr. talked about it. In his famous "I Have a Dream" speech, delivered on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in 1963, King began by referencing the Emancipation Proclamation as an unfulfilled promise.</p>
                
                <p>Civil rights leaders used the Proclamation as both inspiration and a reminder that the work of freedom was incomplete. They argued that true emancipation required not just legal freedom but also economic opportunity, political participation, and social equality.</p>
                
                <div class="quote-box">
                    <blockquote>
                        "Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice."
                    </blockquote>

                <h3>Global Influence</h3>
                <p>The Emancipation Proclamation influenced freedom movements around the world. It demonstrated that even established systems of oppression could be challenged and changed through political action and moral leadership.</p>
                
                <p>The document became a symbol of hope for oppressed peoples globally, showing that governments could choose justice over economic interests and political convenience.</p>
                
                <h3>Modern Relevance</h3>
                <p>Today, the Proclamation reminds us that the fight for equality is ongoing. While legal slavery ended, the struggle for true equality continues in areas such as criminal justice reform, economic opportunity, and educational access.</p>
                
                <p>The document teaches us that meaningful change often requires bold leadership, even when the immediate results are limited. Lincoln's willingness to act, despite political risks and constitutional uncertainties, provides a model for modern leaders facing difficult moral choices.</p>
                
                <h3>Personal Reflection</h3>
                <p>It makes me think about how hard it is to fight for change, but also how one action can make a difference. The Emancipation Proclamation shows that individual decisions can have profound historical consequences.</p>
                
                <p>The document also reminds us that progress is often incremental. While the Proclamation didn't immediately solve the problem of slavery, it set in motion forces that eventually led to full emancipation and civil rights.</p>
                
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p><strong>Enduring Message:</strong> The Emancipation Proclamation teaches us that the arc of history bends toward justice, but only when people are willing to take action, even when the path forward is uncertain and the immediate results are limited.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h3>Lessons for Today</h3>
                <p>The Proclamation's legacy challenges us to consider what bold actions our generation might need to take to advance justice and equality. It reminds us that waiting for perfect conditions or complete solutions can prevent us from taking necessary first steps.</p>
                
                <p>Just as Lincoln acted within the constraints of his time while pushing toward a more just future, we too must work within our current limitations while striving for a better tomorrow.</p>
