            <h2>The Proclamation</h2>
            <div class="content-box">
                <h3>What It Did</h3>
                <p>On January 1, 1863, Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation. It only said slaves in the Confederate states were free. This decision was both a military tactic and a moral statement that transformed the purpose of the Civil War.</p>
                
                <p>The Proclamation applied to approximately 3.5 million enslaved people in the rebellious states. It declared them "forever free" and allowed the Union Army to enforce this freedom as they advanced into Confederate territory.</p>
                
                <h3>What It Didn't Do</h3>
                <p>The Emancipation Proclamation didn't free everyone — border states that stayed in the Union still had slavery. The Proclamation specifically excluded Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri, along with parts of Virginia and Louisiana under Union control.</p>
                
                <p>This limitation was intentional. Lincoln needed to keep the loyalty of the border states and avoid pushing them toward the Confederacy. The Proclamation was carefully crafted to maximize the Union's advantage while minimizing political risk.</p>
                
                <div class="quote-box">
                    <blockquote>
                        "All persons held as slaves within said designated States... are, and henceforward shall be free."
                    </blockquote>

                <h3>Legal and Constitutional Basis</h3>
                <p>Lincoln justified the Proclamation as a war measure under his constitutional powers as Commander-in-Chief. He argued that freeing enslaved people in rebellious states would impede the Confederacy's ability to continue the war.</p>
                
                <p>This strategy was crucial because it allowed Lincoln to act without Congressional approval. However, it also meant the Proclamation's effects likely would not survive the end of the war without additional amendments.</p>
                
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p><strong>Strategic Impact:</strong> By framing emancipation as a military necessity rather than just a moral essential, Lincoln made it harder to oppose the Proclamation on constitutional grounds.</p>
