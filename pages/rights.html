            <h2>Rights & Responsibilities</h2>
            <div class="content-box">
                <h3>Rights Gained</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Enslaved people in the South were freed from bondage</li>
                    <li>Black men could fight in the war and serve their country</li>
                    <li>Freedom of movement and the right to seek employment</li>
                    <li>The right to family unity and legal marriage</li>
                    <li>Access to education and literacy</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>These rights represented a fundamental transformation in the legal status of millions of African Americans. For the first time, they could make choices about their own lives, work for wages, and build families without fear of separation.</p>
                
                <h3>The Path to Full Freedom</h3>
                <p>The Emancipation Proclamation was just the beginning. True freedom required additional constitutional amendments and protections to ensure that emancipation would be permanent. </p>
                
                <h3>13th Amendment (1865)</h3>
                <p>This law ended slavery in the whole country. Unlike the Emancipation Proclamation- a wartime measure- the 13th Amendment permanently abolished slavery throughout the United States, including the border states that had been excluded from the Proclamation.</p>
                
                <p>The amendment's passage required a 2/3 majority in both houses of Congress and endorsement by 3/4 of the states. This process ensured that the end of slavery had both national support and constitutional permanence.</p>
                
                <h3>Responsibilities of Freedom</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Freedom came with responsibilities — people had to follow new laws, vote, and treat everyone fairly</li>
                    <li>The obligation to participate in democratic processes and civic life</li>
                    <li>The responsibility to educate themselves and their children</li>
                    <li>The duty to contribute to society through work and community involvement</li>
                    <li>The responsibility to respect the rights of others</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>National Responsibilities</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The country had to live up to its promises of justice</li>
                    <li>Ensuring equal protection under the law for all citizens</li>
                    <li>Providing opportunities for education and economic advancement</li>
                    <li>Protecting the civil rights of formerly enslaved people</li>
                    <li>Creating a completely inclusive democracy</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p><strong>The Reciprocal Nature of Rights:</strong> The Emancipation Proclamation demonstrated that rights and responsibilities are connected. As African Americans gained the right to freedom, they also accepted the responsibility of citizenship. This included military service and civic participation.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h3>Challenges to Implementation</h3>
                <p>Gaining rights on paper was only the first step. Formerly enslaved people faced enormous challenges in exercising their new freedoms. They endured economic hardship, lack of education, and violent resistance from those who opposed emancipation.</p>
                
                <p>The federal government struggled to protect these new rights, especially after the end of Reconstruction in 1877. This led to the rise of Jim Crow laws and discrimination that would persist for nearly a century.</p>
                
                <h3>The Ongoing Struggle</h3>
                <p>The relationship between rights and responsibilities established by the Emancipation Proclamation continues to evolve. Each generation must work to fulfill the promise of freedom and equality for all Americans.</p>
